// Write a program that prompts a user for their data: username, age, and a list of their favorite movies. Store the information and then showcase it in the console. Take note that the output for the films should add a small message like: 'The film {film} is one of my favorites'.

// const getUsername = prompt("Whaats your username? ");
// console.log(getUsername);
// const getAge = prompt("Whaats your age? ");
// console.log(getAge);
// const getFavoriteMovies = prompt("what are your favorite movies? (each separated by comma)");
// const film = getFavoriteMovies.slice(0, 5)
// console.log( getFavoriteMovies);
// console.log(`The film ${film} is one of my favorites`);
